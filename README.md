# Introduction
Welcome to the 100 Days of Code Challenge in C++! This challenge is designed to help you build consistent coding habits, improve your C++ programming skills, and learn new concepts through daily coding practice. Each day, you will work on a new problem or project, share your progress, and reflect on what you've learned.

# Objectives
Develop consistent coding habits by coding every day for 100 days.
Improve your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding of C++.
Explore a wide range of C++ concepts, from basics to advanced topics.
Build a portfolio of C++ projects and solutions.
Engage with the coding community by sharing your progress and learning from others.
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of C++ syntax and programming concepts.
A C++ compiler installed on your computer (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
A code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Visual Studio).
Challenge Structure
Each day, you will:

## Solve a Problem or Work on a Project: Choose a coding problem or project to work on. This can range from simple algorithmic challenges to more complex projects.
## Document Your Progress: Write a brief summary of what you worked on, what you learned, and any challenges you faced.
## Share Your Progress: Post your daily update on social media or a coding community using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.

## Conclusion
By the end of this 100 Days of Code Challenge, you will have significantly improved your C++ skills, built a habit of coding daily, and created a portfolio of projects and solutions. Stay consistent, keep learning, and enjoy the journey!
